TradingView PineScript Downloader

**Description**
---------------
A concurrent web scraper written in Python using Selenium and aiohttp to download PineScripts from TradingView, a popular online community of traders.

**Features**
------------

*   **Concurrent Page Downloading**: I built this to take advantage of multi-core processors by downloading multiple pages concurrently.
*   **PineScript Code Extraction**: One cool feature is the ability to extract and save PineScript code from TradingView's script pages, which can then be used for backtesting or other purposes.
*   **Headless Browsing**: I configured Firefox to run in headless mode using geckodriver, making it possible to scrape content without displaying any browser windows.
*   **Directory Management**: The project creates a designated directory for storing downloaded PineScripts and checks if files already exist before saving them again.

**Installation**
----------------
Before running the script, make sure you have:

1.  Python installed on your machine (`python --version`)
2.  `geckodriver` executable in your system's PATH (download from [here](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases))
3.  Required libraries:
    *   `selenium`
    *   `aiohttp`
    *   `BeautifulSoup4`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Usage**
---------
Run the script with Python, and it will start downloading PineScripts from TradingView in a concurrent manner. You can adjust the number of concurrent pages by modifying the `num_concurrent_pages` variable.

```python
python main.py
```
